\description{
Probability that an infected individual successfully breaches quarantine
and initiates community transmission, reported separately for travellers
and quarantine workers.
}
\details{
Travellers undergo testing on specific days and may exit with false-negative
results. Workers attend intermittently and face regular testing on attendance
days, creating different breach risk profiles. Worker-initiated breaches
typically show higher probability than traveller-initiated breaches.
